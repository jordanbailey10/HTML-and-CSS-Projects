## Academy Cinemas Website - Bootstrap 
I used bootstrap4 to make this mock website for a movie theater. That I created that includes buttons, a nav bar, pop up forms and more. This was my first project using bootstrap and I'm very happy with how it turned out.

## The Space Station Resort Website
This is a mock website that I made that includes menus, terms and conditions and different animations to the buttons and images. I think it turned out great.
